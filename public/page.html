            <h2>My Journey with Cars</h2>
            <img src="images/car.jpg" alt="My Car" class="float-image">
            <p>I'm Kenan Maslan, a 22-year-old student at Linnaeus University. While my days are often filled with lectures and study sessions, my true passion lies in the world of cars.</p>

            <p>For me, cars are not just about transportation; they are a canvas for creativity, a source of thrill, and a symbol of the journey I am on.</p>

            <p>My fascination with cars goes beyond just driving. I love working on my car, understanding its mechanics.</p>

            <p>I enjoy making tweaks here and there. Every moment spent under the hood is a moment of discovery and learning.</p>

            <p>The road, to me, represents endless possibilities. Whether it's a drive through the city streets or a long cruise on the highway.</p>

            <p>Each journey brings new experiences and a sense of freedom that's hard to find elsewhere.</p>
