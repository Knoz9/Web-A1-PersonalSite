            <h2>My Expectations for the Course</h2>
            <p>As a student at Linnaeus University, I'm really looking forward to learning more about web programming languages in this course. It's exciting to think about all the different languages I'll be able to explore and understand better.</p>
            <p>The idea of actually creating websites myself is something I'm particularly enthusiastic about. I can't wait to start building and see my own web projects come to life. It's going to be a great experience to turn the concepts I learn into real, functioning websites.</p>
